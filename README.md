# Internship topic : 
To view LSTMs and/or Transformers in the context of time-series models, such as AR or ARMA, and to analyze the performance (both theoretical and empirical) of such machine learning-based sequential models from this perspective. The project would involve a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation.
